Chat app using socket.io

I have created chat app project using socket.io, express and grunt.I also minified javascript file using uglify plugin in grunt, moreover, I also use Sass for the css code.I used express.js so I can easily write javascript and using socket to make full featured chat App.

- First I created app.js file to setup express javascript and setup a server for the chat app and then I write the code for routes and static page to connect to the app.js file.
